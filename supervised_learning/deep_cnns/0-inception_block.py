        filters is a tuple or list containing F1, F3R, F3,F5R, F5, FPP,
        respectively:

            *F1 is the number of filters in the 1x1 convolution
            *F3R is the number of filters in the 1x1 convolution
            before the 3x3 convolution
            *F3 is the number of filters in the 3x3 convolution
            *F5R is the number of filters in the 1x1 convolution
            before the 5x5 convolution

            *FPP is the number of filters in the 1x1 convolution

        All convolutions inside the inception block should use a
        rectified linear activation (ReLU)
